### Welcome to our README 
In this project we built a tool to protect against ransom attacks.
The tool should be run inside a particular folder, making sure that no file is encrypted or changed in an unwanted way.

#### Base assumptions:
We assumed that the folder will only find text files (.txt) containing ascii characters.

We have assumed that encryption for the umba is necessarily done on all the folder files together, or on an entire file necessarily. 

In addition, encryption is not, Necessarily, the content of the file becomes "gibberish".
